# Nerd-OpenAL!
My wrapper on [Processing](https://processing.org), [Nerd](https://github.com/Brahvim/TheNerdProject), used to have bult-in support for OpenAL.
Now that it has "extensions" as a feature, I decided to separate the [LWJGL OpenAL wrapper](https://github.com/Brahvim/LWJGL-OpenAL-Wrapper) from the rest!
